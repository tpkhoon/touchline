// The media: five outlets with voices of their own cover your club. After every match, big signing, sale and season they
// print a headline in their own register, and each keeps a view of you (-100 to 100) that moves with results at its own
// speed: the tabloid swings fast and hunts for a crisis, the broadsheet weighs a run of games, the local paper is on your
// side, the television panel argues about the tactics, the radio phone-in is the fans on a bad night. Together their
// mood is the pressure on the club: a hostile press wears down the board's confidence and the fans' patience a little
// every match, a friendly one props them up. It builds on the story feed (FM.Stories) and the press conferences.
//
// State is S.media, made on first use (older saves have none). Choices of wording come from a hash of the match and the
// day, not from random numbers, so nothing here changes how the rest of the world plays out.
